# Frontend Mentor FAQ Accordion Challenge

Following the challenge, I tried my best to replocate the design using HTML, TailwindCSS and JavaScript for the dropdown functionality.

Unfortuinately, I didn't incorporate the keyboard control for the site yet, but everything currently works with mouseclicks at the moment. Will try to add this in the future!

# Running the Files

To run the site locally, please input the following commands:

`npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/cli`


`npx @tailwindcss/cli -i ./src/input.css -o ./dist/style.css --watch`
